STEP 1: DEPLOYMENT Troubleshooting

1. We have observed that hellow-world crashing with the follow error CrashLoopbackOff

bash-3.2$ kubectl get pods
NAME                          READY   STATUS            RESTARTS   AGE
hello-world-d696c5567-rf2t9   0/1     CrashLoopBackOff  6          6m35s

2. We checked the logs from pod hello-world-d696c5567-rf2t9 and we have the next message

bash-3.2$ kubectl logs -f hello-world-d696c5567-rf2t9
 * Running on http://10.100.3.173:9000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)

Failed health check you want to ping /healthz

3. In the file hello.yml in the line 28 we replaced /nginx_status to /healthz

4. We launched another time the file hello.yml with the command:
   kubectl apply -f hello.yml

5. We checked that the pod from hello-world working. Also we checked the logs of pod working

bash-3.2$ kubectl get pods
NAME                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
hello-world-794458d64d-4m2p5   1/1     Running   0          31s

bash-3.2$ kubectl logs -f hello-world-794458d64d-4m2p5
